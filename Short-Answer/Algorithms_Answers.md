## Exercise I

a) The Big-O notation for this algorithm is O(n) the number of operations scales linearly with the input. when n = 10 this code required 10 operations, n= 100, 100 operations, n=1000, 1000 operations. I ran this code to reach that conclusion:

def sprint(n):
    a = 0
    operations = 0
    while (a < n * n * n):
    a = a + n * n
    operations+=1
    print(operations)


b)


c)
